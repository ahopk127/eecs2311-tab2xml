    2. In the window that opens, select "Projects from Git", in the folder called "Git".  Then, click "Next"
       [[../Screenshots/eclipse-install-2.png]]
    3. Click "Clone URI" then click "Next".

    4. Enter "~https://github.com/ahopk127/eecs2311-tab2xml.git~" in the first field ("URI"), then click "Next".  No authentication is required.

    5. Choose where you want the program to be saved on your computer (or just use the default location), then click "Next".
       [[../Screenshots/eclipse-install-5.png]]
    6. Click "Next" then "Finish".  The program is now installed on your computer, but must be built using Gradle.
       [[../Screenshots/eclipse-install-7.png]]
    7. You will need the "Gradle Tasks" window for the next step.  If you can't find it, press ~Window > Show View > Other~ in the menu, then find "Gradle Tasks" in the Gradle folder, then click "Open".

    8. In the "Gradle Tasks" window, double-click the green "build" item in the "build" folder.

*** Commandline
    1. Use the command ~git clone https://github.com/ahopk127/eecs2311-tab2xml.git~ to clone the project to the directory of your choice
    2. Change directory to the directory where you installed the project, then use ~./gradlew build~ to build the project.
** Convert Text Tab
   1. Run the application.  In Eclipse, double-click the green "run" item in the "application folder".  In commandline, use ~gradlew run~.\\
      You should see a window like this:
      [[../Screenshots/main-interface.png]]
   2. Input your text tab into the application.  There are multiple ways of doing this:
      - Type or copy-and-paste your text tab into the text box.  
      - Press the "Load from File" button then choose a file to load your text tab from a file.  
      - Drag and drop a text tab file into the input box
      [[../Screenshots/text-tab.png]]
   3. Press the "Convert" button.  The text tab will be replaced with the corresponding MusicXML.

   4. You can now copy-and-paste the MusicXML, or save it to a file using the "Save to File" button.
** Other Use Cases
   - You can use the "Convert and Save" button to convert a text tab and save it to a file in one step.  In addition, the tab in the input box will not be replaced with MusicXML, so you can edit it then convert again!
   - After converting text tab with the "Convert" button, you can press the "Undo Conversion" button to go back to the original text tab.
   - To clear the text box, press Ctrl-A then Delete.  If you want to load in another text tab, you don't need to do this.  Simply press "Load from File" to load another text tab.
** How to Use in Code
   If you would like to use this project in your own program, the following code can be used to convert tab to MusicXML:
   
#+BEGIN_SRC java
tab2xml.parser.Parser parser = new tab2xml.parser.Parser(INPUT, INSTRUMENT);  
String output = parser.parse();  
#+END_SRC

   Notes:
    - INPUT is the text tab.  It should be a ~String~, not a file.
    - INSTRUMENT is the instrument the tab is for.  It should be an instance of ~tab2xml.parser.Instrument~.
    - You will need to handle the checked exceptions thrown by ~Parser.parse()~
