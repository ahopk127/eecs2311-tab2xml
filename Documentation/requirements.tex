\section{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:org14dc261}
\subsection{Functionality}
\label{sec:orgc561520}
\begin{itemize}
\item Must convert text tablature to MusicXML tablature
\item Must be able to read guitar, drum and bass text tabs
\item Must be able to access and edit the original text tab after conversion
\item Must be able to account for drop tunings
\item Must be able to account for an unusual amount of strings in guitar tabs
\item Must be compatible with music in any time signature or key
\item Should be able to notate techniques such as bends, slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability}
\label{sec:orge7b56c5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Must have an intuitive visual interface
\item Must be able to accept copy-pasted text or text read from a file
\item Must automatically detect which instrument the tab is for
\item Must allow the user to override this instrument detection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reliability}
\label{sec:org86adf94}
\begin{itemize}
\item Must be able to work with lots of variation in the format of the text tab
\item The converted MusicXML tablature must be error free
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\label{sec:orge81867d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Must convert the text tab in a reasonable amount of time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supportability}
\label{sec:orgacd24fa}
\begin{itemize}
\item Should allow the user to configure their preferences for how they want the drums sheet music to be displayed (selecting the value and noteheads). Can have a default notation but should be able to be customized through preferences

\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:org52447fc}

\section{Use Cases}
\label{sec:org438b5a5}
\subsection{Convert Text Tab}
\label{sec:orge105ce4}
Primary Actor: Musician
Goal: The musician has a text tab, and they want a MusicXML file
Success Scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Musician starts program
\item Musician inputs the text tab
\item System identifies what instrument it is for
\item Musician tells system to convert text tab
\item System converts text tab to MusicXML
\item Musician saves output
\item Musician closes program
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Extensions}
\label{sec:orga29f8ba}
3a. If system cannot identify instrument, user can choose instrument manually.
5a. If text tab is unrecognizable, notify user and restart at step 2

\subsection{Change Settings}
\label{sec:orga3d6cb7}
Primary Actor: Musician
Success Scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Musician starts program (if it isn't already started)
\item Musician changes settings
\item System updates settings internally
\item Musician stops program or continues using program for something else
\end{enumerate}
