\section{Use Cases}
\label{sec:org62c2fc7}
\subsection{Convert Text Tab}
\label{sec:orgbfbcbcb}
Primary Actor: Musician
Goal: The musician has a text tab, and they want a MusicXML file
Success Scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Musician starts program
\item Musician inputs the text tab
\item System identifies what instrument it is for
\item Musician tells system to convert text tab
\item System converts text tab to MusicXML
\item Musician saves output
\item Musician closes program
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Extensions}
\label{sec:orga0f60d6}
3a. If system cannot identify instrument, user can choose instrument manually.
5a. If text tab is unrecognizable, notify user and restart at step 2

\subsection{Change Settings}
\label{sec:org5d4a5f7}
Primary Actor: Musician
Success Scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Musician starts program (if it isn't already started)
\item Musician changes settings
\item System updates settings internally
\item Musician stops program or continues using program for something else
\end{enumerate}
