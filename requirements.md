# Project Requirements
 - Convert text tabs to MusicXML
 - Should be able to read guitar, drum and bass text tabs
 - Should be able to work with lots of variation in the format of the text tab
 
## Possible Requirements (things to ask customer)
 - Do we want to be able to input text into the program, or read from a file only?
 - Are there certain applications that our outputted files must support (e.g. MuseScore)?
 - Should it have a GUI, or should it be a commandline program?
 - Does our program need to account for drop tunings? (guitars sometime change the notes of the top string)
 - Does our program need to account for guitars with an unusual amount of strings? (its not completely uncommon for 7 or 8 string guitars)
