(i dont think this is important) Score Instrument. Each piece of the drumkit might need to be created at the beginning of the xml file
<score-instrument id="P1-I36">
        <instrument-name>Bass Drum 1</instrument-name>
        </score-instrument>

- beginning information will be mostly the same as guitar except the clef will be percussion

note

 <note>
        <unpitched>
          <display-step>G</display-step>
          <display-octave>5</display-octave>
          </unpitched>
        <duration>2</duration>
        <instrument id="P1-I43"/>
        <voice>1</voice>
        <type>eighth</type>
        <stem>up</stem>
        <notehead>x</notehead>
        <beam number="1">continue</beam>
        </note>

- step and octave are the same as before except octave will be 4 or 5 basically always. User might need to input which notes they want as which drum
-instrument id doesnt seem important but it is linked to the "score-instrument" part above.
-voice is still useless
-good luck with duration and type
- stem i would honestly just put as up if the octave is 5 and down if its 4 or just pick randomly
- notehead is really important however i think the user will need to input which noteheads they want.
     - noteheads include slash, triangle, diamond, square, cross, x, circle-x, inverted triangle, arrow down, arrow up, 
	circled, slashed, back slashed, normal, cluster, circle dot, left triangle, rectangle, none, do, re, mi, fa, fa up, so, la, ti, and other
	(I SWEAR HALF OF THESE DONT WORK. if you dont include notehead it will default to regular music notes. x and default are most common. maybe diamond)
- beam doesnt change much but makes the notes look nicer. I'd test this one out before deciding how/if you want to implement it. It has a huge impact on the 
  order of the notes. it seems like a group of eighth notes are connected by beam number 1 and sixteenth are connected by 2.
  Follows a "begin, continue, end" pattern for all the notes in a beam.
- chords are still a thing.
