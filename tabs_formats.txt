THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR
-lower case e for the bottom high pitched e (e in octave 4 i think)
-changing the among of strings randomly
-random words or blocks of text
heres an example of these 3 things being seen: https://www.guitartabs.cc/tabs/e/eagles/hotel_california_tab.html

-having the strings numbered 1-6 instead of lettered

- lots of words and the chord that needs to be played in letter form
- if there's a bunch of "x"s instead of numbers it means you play muted notes
