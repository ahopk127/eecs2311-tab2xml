Most of the beginning stuff is going to be copy and paste. 


key/ fifths = represents the key. EDIT not important for tabs. do this
 <key>
          <fifths>0</fifths>
          </key>
time / beats / beat type = what the time signature is aka how many of those vertical lines there are. usually 4/4 however in capricho we counted 3 so its likely beats is 3 and beat type is 4 so 3/4. time signatures are almost always 4/4 and when theyre not theyre usually 3/4 or 6/8
ex. 
 <time>
          <beats>4</beats>
          <beat-type>4</beat-type>
          </time>
CLEF-
<clef>
          <sign>TAB</sign>
          <line>2</line>
        </clef>
EDIT - this represents the clef which isnt really important for tabs so dont worry just copy this

<staff-details>
          <staff-lines>6</staff-lines>
          <staff-tuning line="1">
            <tuning-step>E</tuning-step>
            <tuning-octave>2</tuning-octave>
          </staff-tuning>
          <staff-tuning line="2">

- straightforward. sets what note each string is. do this 6 or however many times. its the very first column of letters in the text tab.

<measure number="(whichever measure it is)">
-adds a measure. starting from 1 at the beginning of the tab. REMINDER a measure is the block of time that is split up by the dotted vertical lines. 

ATTRIBUTES OF NOTES

<note>
-starts a note

<rest/>
- if there is no note then a rest needs to be added to fill up the remaining time in the measure

<chord/>
-if this note is part of a chord with the last note add this to the start of the note

-<pitch> 
	<step>(whatever note you want)</step>
-selects the note so like C or A or something

<alter>
--1 is a flat, 1 is a sharp

<octave>(whatever octave)</octave>
-basically whatever octave so for example the low E on the guitar is an E in the 2 octave and the high E is a 4 or 5 or something

<duration></duration>
-how LONG(in beats) the note is played for. see type

<type>
-what type of note. MUST correspond to the duration. in the form duration=type: 0.25=sixteenth, 0.5=eighth, 1=quarter, 2=half, 4=whole. this scales with the divisions number at the beginning of the document.

<stem>none</stem>
- write none for no stem or down for a stem idk this is SUPER useless but semi needed for some reason?

SPECIFYING THE STRING AND FRET THE NOTE IS ON
 <technical>
            <string>3</string>
            <fret>5</fret>
          </technical>
-straightforward just add this after the other stuff in the note to show which string and fret

HAMMER ONS AND PULLOFFS 
-SUPER confusing but basically the first note of the hammer on will look something like this
<hammer-on number="1" type="start">H</hammer-on>
            <string>3</string>
            <fret>5</fret>
          </technical>
          <slur number="1" placement="above" type="start"/>

and then the second note of the hammer on will look something like this 

<technical>
            <string>3</string>
            <fret>7</fret>
            <hammer-on number="1" type="stop"/>
          </technical>
          <slur number="1" type="stop"/>

FINALLY 
just like other languages that start and end things with {}, musicxml does it by rewriting the <(whatever)> things. so for example when creating a note itll begin with <note> and end with </note>. the / is the closing part

This doc doesnt have drums but i'll add that later
